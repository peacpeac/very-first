My very first repository on GitHub
Empty so far, soon to contain few simple projects.
About me.
I have been programming in Fortran, Assembler (and hexcode) of 8080 processor. My last programming language was Borland Pascal 20 years ago,
since that I have been doing scripting in Lotus Notes and during last 10 years did not write a single line of code. Now I decided to
return to the coding, starting with Python.
